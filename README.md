# DBAS 5125 - Exercise 6 

##  Case Study #1: House Prices Dataset
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in **Google Colab** as shown in class 
- When satisficed that you have completed the required changes in Colab commit your Jupyter Notebook back to GitHub as shown in class 
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the exercise. 

 ### Preliminary Steps

- We will use the included Iowa House Price training dataset ( source: [Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) )

- Import the data into Pandas as perhaps a raw GitHub URL import if using Google Colab

### Tasks

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    
    - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Check for data types, and basic statistics using Pandas functions

**NOTE: The data set is large and has many columns. You might want to follow the YData suggestions for handling large datasets [YData Profiling: Profiling large datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/big_data/).**

2.  **Data Profiling:**

    - Use YData Profiling or a similar tool to generate a data profile report.
    - Analyze key data quality metrics such as completeness, uniqueness, and missing values.
    - Explore the distribution of each feature

3.  **Data Visualization:**
    
    - Use either Seaborn Plotly or both  to generate some useful data visualizations.
    - Create scatter plots or pair plots to visualize relationships between numerical features and the target variable (sale prices).
    - Utilize box plots or violin plots to showcase variations in the target variable across different categories.

- Copy screenshots into the repository showing the output(s) of each of the above 3 phases
